# mindstreams-recommendations-api

Implements a Recommendations API for a given site and user based on a combination of the user's recent learning context and their most recent MindStreams cognive context. It has a simple heuristic for now but it leverages ML-based scores that are written by the Lambda ingestion processor to DynamoDB.
